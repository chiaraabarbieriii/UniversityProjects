    "# Customer analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of this project is to be able to successfully apply classification and clustering on a dataset and be able to analyze and make predictions that are relevant to the goal predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I have chosen a dataset which collects the data that is necessary to analyse a customer behavior when making a purchase within a company, so a *Customer Personality Analysis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link to find the dataset that was used is:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "The goal of this project is to:\n",
    "1. Predict whether offers are an effective method to have a client buy in the store - We will be doing this by using binary classification of the attribute \"Response\", since it tells us whether a customer accepted the offer (1) or refused (0) - classify features values in 1 or 0. It is done in this notebook.\n",
    "2. Segment customers based on their characteristics such as age, income, family situation... -  We will identify distinct customer groups that may have different needs and behaviors by applying clustering techniques. Look at the notebook \"Clustering\" - We will first segment customers based on all the characteristics given by the dataset and afterwards we will only consider their spending habits and Income to segregate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "In this dataset the attributes are divided into four different types of categories\n",
    "\n",
    "**People**\n",
    "- ID: Customer's unique identifier\n",
    "- Year_Birth: Customer's birth year\n",
    "- Education: Customer's education level\n",
    "- Marital_Status: Customer's marital status\n",
    "- Income: Customer's yearly household income\n",
    "- Kidhome: Number of children in customer's household\n",
    "- Teenhome: Number of teenagers in customer's household\n",
    "- Dt_Customer: Date of customer's enrollment with the company\n",
    "- Recency: Number of days since customer's last purchase\n",
    "- Complain: 1 if the customer complained in the last 2 years, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Products**\n",
    "- MntWines: Amount spent on wine in last 2 years\n",
    "- MntFruits: Amount spent on fruits in last 2 years\n",
    "- MntMeatProducts: Amount spent on meat in last 2 years\n",
    "- MntFishProducts: Amount spent on fish in last 2 years\n",
    "- MntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in last 2 years\n",
    "- MntGoldProds: Amount spent on gold in last 2 years\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promotions**\n",
    "- NumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount\n",
    "- AcceptedCmp1: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- AcceptedCmp2: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- AcceptedCmp3: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- AcceptedCmp4: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- AcceptedCmp5: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- Response: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Place of purchase**\n",
    "- NumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company’s website\n",
    "- NumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalogue\n",
    "- NumStorePurchases: Number of purchases made directly in stores\n",
    "- NumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to company’s website in the last month\n",
