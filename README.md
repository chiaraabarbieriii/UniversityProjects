## Machine learning project: Customer analysis
The intent of this project is to be able to successfully apply classification and clustering on a dataset and be able to analyze and make predictions that are relevant to the goal predefined.
For this project I have chosen a dataset which collects the data that is necessary to analyse a customer behavior when making a purchase within a company, so a *Customer Personality Analysis*.
The link to find the dataset that was used is:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

**GOAL**: 
1. Predict whether offers are an effective method to have a client buy in the store - We will be doing this by using binary classification of the attribute "Response", since it tells us whether a customer accepted the offer (1) or refused (0) - classify features values in 1 or 0. It is done in this notebook.
2. Segment customers based on their characteristics such as age, income, family situation... -  We will identify distinct customer groups that may have different needs and behaviors by applying clustering techniques. Look at the notebook "Clustering" - We will first segment customers based on all the characteristics given by the dataset and afterwards we will only consider their spending habits and Income to segregate them.

*When I have done this project?* This project was done in the second year, first semester, of the bachelor in Artificial Intelligence. This is the first project I have completed

## Fuzzy systems project: Implement the softpy library to utilize the horizontal representation
**GOAL**: 
The intent of this project is to implement the horizontal representation of a fuzzy set, such that when given a point you get the corresponding membership value found through the alpha cut.

## Computer programming: Create an ecosystem with Python
**GOAL**: 
The intent of the project is to create an ecosystem that is able to simulate the behaviour of three species (two animals and one species of plant) within the same world and shows how they interact. One day is divided i multiple phases that determine the behaviour of the animals and of the plants.
The project was done in a group of two.

## Information retrieval and recommender system project
**GOAL**:
The goal of the project is to develop a search engine capable of retrieving relevant answers to user queries from a community Question Answering dataset. The answers should integrate personalization to tailor search outcomes based on the user's historical activity and contextual features, as well as the recommender system's scores.

## Project of Natural Language Processing: classification of text
**Goal**:
The project was based on the creation of a Transformer that could classify text into different categories (multiclass classification)

## Project about the analysis of the effect of TikTok on users
**Goal**:
Investigate the human factors involved in the usage of TikTok and the possible changes that could be done to the interface to have a more mindful interaction with the app

## Project investigating AI relevance in academic tasks
**Goal**:
Development of a SWOT analysis, with the help of chatGPT and Claude as mentors, on the help of chatGPT to do an academic task

## Project on segmenting a brain tumor
**Goal**: 
Exploiting fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to do a tumor segmentation in the brain

## Project on breast cancer classification using MLP
**Goal**:
The goal of the project is to create a Neural Network for breast Cancer Classification, more precisely, we want to implement a Multilayer Perceptron.

## Churn prediction model
**Goal**:
During the project a churn prediction model was created, with the aim of predicting which customers are at risk of churning (Assign a probability of churn to each customer)
