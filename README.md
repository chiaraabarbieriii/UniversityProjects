## Machine learning project: Customer analysis
The intent of this project is to be able to successfully apply classification and clustering on a dataset and be able to analyze and make predictions that are relevant to the goal predefined.
For this project I have chosen a dataset which collects the data that is necessary to analyse a customer behavior when making a purchase within a company, so a *Customer Personality Analysis*.
The link to find the dataset that was used is:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

**GOAL**: 
1. Predict whether offers are an effective method to have a client buy in the store - We will be doing this by using binary classification of the attribute "Response", since it tells us whether a customer accepted the offer (1) or refused (0) - classify features values in 1 or 0. It is done in this notebook.
2. Segment customers based on their characteristics such as age, income, family situation... -  We will identify distinct customer groups that may have different needs and behaviors by applying clustering techniques. Look at the notebook "Clustering" - We will first segment customers based on all the characteristics given by the dataset and afterwards we will only consider their spending habits and Income to segregate them.

*When I have done this project?* This project was done in the second year, first semester, of the bachelor in Artificial Intelligence. This is the first project I have completed

## Fuzzy systems project: Implement the softpy library to utilize the horizontal representation
**GOAL/**
The intent of this project is to implement the horizontal representation of a fuzzy set, such that when given a point you get the corresponding membership value found through the alpha cut.

## Computer programming: Create an ecosystem with Python
**GOAL/**
The intent of the project is to create an ecosystem that is able to simulate the behaviour of three species (two animals and one species of plant) within the same world and shows how they interact. One day is divided i multiple phases that determine the behaviour of the animals and of the plants.
