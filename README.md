## Machine learning project: Customer analysis
The intent of this project is to be able to successfully apply classification and clustering on a dataset and be able to analyze and make predictions that are relevant to the goal predefined.
For this project I have chosen a dataset which collects the data that is necessary to analyse a customer behavior when making a purchase within a company, so a *Customer Personality Analysis*.
The link to find the dataset that was used is:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

**GOAL**: 
1. Predict whether offers are an effective method to have a client buy in the store - We will be doing this by using binary classification of the attribute "Response", since it tells us whether a customer accepted the offer (1) or refused (0) - classify features values in 1 or 0. It is done in this notebook.
2. Segment customers based on their characteristics such as age, income, family situation... -  We will identify distinct customer groups that may have different needs and behaviors by applying clustering techniques. Look at the notebook "Clustering" - We will first segment customers based on all the characteristics given by the dataset and afterwards we will only consider their spending habits and Income to segregate them.

*When I have done this project?* This project was done in the second year, first semester, of the bachelor in Artificial Intelligence. This is the first project I have completed
