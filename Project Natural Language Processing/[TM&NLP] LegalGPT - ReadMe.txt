INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
Everything is already within the code, so nothing has to be done in order to visualize and run the code. 
This applies if you run the code on Google Colab because if you do not the dataset can not be read.

EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
Here's a pipeline on the contents of the source code:
1.  Load of the raw dataset
2.  Data exploration and extraction
3.  Basic text cleaning
4.  Dataset splitting
5.  Tokenization using the BPE tokenizer
6.  Data loaders definition
7.  Model definition
     7.1 Custom Transformer)
     7.2 Transformer Wrapper
8.  Optimization through hyper parameter tuning
9.  Training of the model over the training set
10. Model analysis and evaluation on the test set
11. Pre-trained model comparison

Given these steps, more explanations can be found as comments within the source code or in the report.
